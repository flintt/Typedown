# Showcase document

`showcase.md` is a single Markdown document (about 1,100 lines) that contains every element this editor supports, the tricky cases around each one, and a section of deliberately broken input. It has two uses:

1. **Fixture**: `node showcase-check.js` (in `Tools/EditorBench`) loads it into the built editor headlessly and checks it.
2. **Side-by-side comparison**: open the same file in Typora, MarkText, Obsidian, VS Code's preview and on GitHub, and compare the results section by section.

`images/` holds the pictures it uses. They are small generated files (PNG, JPEG, SVG and a PNG with spaces in its name). The document uses no web images, so it renders the same offline and fetches nothing.

## Sections

Each section opens with an italic line saying what it checks. Items that this editor does not support are marked **(not supported here)** in the text.

| # | Section | Standard? | What it covers |
|---|---------|-----------|----------------|
| – | Front matter | extension | YAML between `---` lines at the top of the file |

## What differs between editors

- **GitHub** renders maths, Mermaid, footnotes, task lists (ordered ones too), `> [!NOTE]` alerts, `:shortcode:` emoji and single-tilde strikethrough. It shows front matter as a table and `[TOC]` as text. It has no `==highlight==`. It shows `flowchart`, `sequence`, `vega-lite` and `plantuml` fences as code, and removes `style`, `<script>`, `<iframe>` and event handlers.
- **Typora** renders front matter, `[TOC]`, highlight, maths, Mermaid, flowchart.js and js-sequence. `^sup^` and `~sub~` work once enabled in its settings. It has no Vega-Lite or PlantUML.
- **MarkText**, which this editor is based on, behaves much like this editor. With its extension options on, it also renders `^sup^`/`~sub~`.
- **Obsidian** renders maths, Mermaid, highlight, footnotes, wiki links, `%%comments%%` and alerts (callouts). Front matter appears as Properties. It does not render `[TOC]`, flowchart.js, js-sequence, Vega-Lite or PlantUML (only through plugins), and it does not render `:shortcode:` emoji.
- **VS Code's built-in preview** renders CommonMark/GFM plus front matter (hidden) and maths. Mermaid, emoji shortcodes, highlight and footnotes need extensions. It shows the other diagram fences as code.
- Most editors use their own Mermaid version, so newer diagram types (mindmap, timeline) may fail in older ones.
- PlantUML is **off by default in this editor**: drawing a diagram sends its source to a PlantUML server, so the block shows a notice until the setting is turned on.

## This editor: what to expect

- The editor shows these as text: backslash hard breaks, lazy quote continuation lines (the editor ends the quote), ordered task lists, and everything in section 20.
- `[TOC]` shows as text while you edit. The HTML/PDF export replaces it with a table of contents.
- **Known issue:** `\ce{…}` (mhchem) shows as an invalid formula. The mhchem extension is imported, but its macros do not reach the KaTeX instance that renders.
- **Known issue:** a reference-style image (`![…][ref]`) shows as failed when the document opens. It appears the next time its paragraph is rendered (for example, after a click or keystroke in it). Inline images appear straight away.
- An empty `$$` / `$$` pair is not an empty block here. The editor needs at least one character between the lines, so the opening `$$` pairs with the next `$$` line further down. Section 22.8 is written so this is visible: the sentence after the empty pair ends up inside a formula.
- In section 22, every block marked `BROKEN-ON-PURPOSE` shows an "Invalid … Codes/Formula" notice, and the empty Mermaid block shows "Empty Mermaid Block". The script, `onerror` and `onclick` do not run, and the `<iframe>` is removed.

## Normalisation this editor applies

Until the first edit, the editor writes the file back byte for byte. On the first edit it rewrites the whole document from its own model. `showcase-check.js` compares that rewrite (`getMarkdown()`) with the file. These differences come up, and none of them loses text:

- Closing `#`s are removed from headings, the three-space indent before a heading is removed, and empty headings get a trailing space (`# `).
- Table delimiter rows become `| --- |:---:| ---:|` and cell padding is removed. A missing cell is added as an empty cell.
- `~~~` fences are rewritten as backtick fences, one longer than any fence inside. An unclosed fence gets a closing fence. Empty fenced blocks get one blank line inside.
- A blank line is inserted between reference definitions, between a paragraph and a following table, fence or quote, between a list and a following heading, and between two adjacent fences.
- Empty quote lines become `> ` (with a trailing space), and a blank `> ` line is inserted between a quote paragraph and a nested quote.
- Ordered lists numbered `1. 1. 1.` are renumbered `1. 2. 3.`, and `[X]` becomes `[x]`.
- Footnote definitions move to the end of the document. A multi-paragraph footnote starts with `[^long]:` on its own line and has its first paragraph indented below it.
- Whitespace-only lines become empty lines.
- These change how the document renders elsewhere, but still keep the text:
  - The lazy continuation line is written as its own paragraph after the quote.
  - The `*` and `+` lists in section 8 come back loose: the blank line between the two lists moves to between their items.
  - A blank line is inserted after a stray `$$`.
- **Text is lost** in one case only: cells beyond the header's column count (`surplus1`, `surplus2` in 22.3) are dropped. GFM ignores those cells when rendering, so nothing visible changes, but they disappear from the file after the first edit. The check lists this as a known loss.

## Running the check

```bash
cd Tools/EditorBench
npm ci                       # once; or reuse an existing node_modules
node showcase-check.js       # PASS/FAIL, render counts, a short diff of the rewrite
node showcase-check.js --full-diff
node showcase-check.js path/to/other.md
```

The check needs the built editor in `Dev/Typedown/Resources/Statics` and Chrome at `/opt/google/chrome/chrome` (or set `CHROME`). It fails in any of these cases:

- the page throws an error;
- a diagram or formula fails, other than those marked `BROKEN-ON-PURPOSE` and the known `\ce` issue;
- a block marked `BROKEN-ON-PURPOSE` renders;
- a local image fails to load, other than `does-not-exist*` and the known reference-image issue;
- section 22's script or event handlers run;
- a word or invisible character from the file is missing from the rewrite (apart from the known table-cell loss);
- the unedited flush differs from the file.

Normalisation differences are printed but do not fail the check.

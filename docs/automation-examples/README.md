# Automation client examples

Direct clients of the local automation API (`docs/automation-api-spec.md`), without typedownctl or typedown-mcp.
Turn the API on in Typedown first: Settings > General > Allow local automation.

- `typedown_client.py`: Python 3.8+, standard library only. `list`, `read`, `replace-text`.
- `Typedown-Client.ps1`: Windows PowerShell 5.1+. `Connect-Typedown`, `Initialize-Typedown`, `Invoke-Typedown`,
  `Set-TypedownText`.

Both show the one rule every writer must follow: read, write against the revision you read, and when the write fails
with `revision_conflict` or `match_count_mismatch`, read again and decide again from the new text. Never resend an edit
computed from old text.

Tested: `ClientExampleTests` runs the Python example against a pipe server (including a reader typing between its read
and its write); E2E EX01 runs both against the Windows test host.
